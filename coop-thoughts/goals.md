# {{page.title}}

With my (sure to evolve, in conversation with others posts so far) [Principles](/blog/2021/04/coop-principles/) out there, let's get more concrete.

### Current position

I have a current part-time long-term freelance role with a consulting agency and a handful of dormant relationships. Up until 4 years ago I worked full-time, and before that far too much, but now I have a daughter and partner and aging (healthy) parents that all get the lion's share of my time on a weekly basis. We have healthcare through my partner's work as a college professor (though prior to ACA we paid for individual insurance and recoil at the memory). There's a lot of room to bend and sway here, which I hope translates to useful feedback and support of a new collective, if fewer bursts of raw time.

It's somewhat liberating but also depressing that I'm not confident that any of my prior paid consulting relationships would pass principled peer judgement as acceptable clients, though I've been out of the directly ugly adtech and finance world for a decade. I'm hopeful that a more intentional pursuit of collectively-minded needs finds steady meaningful work, while acknowledging we're all here to successfully substitute for real income.


### Goals

- Personal
    - Meaningful ethical projects and team environment.
    - Substitute worker-owned team for independent contracting income.
    - Technical skills growth sharing and renewed challenge.
- Organizational
    - A tension between a small group depending on the involvement and shared commitment of its members, and wanting a structure and organization that fluidly accepts and evolves with changes in membership.
    - The stories in Tech Work Co-op describe very small organizations that mostly have only minimal staff growth expectations, and I concur.
    - Echoing others, a culture of mentoring and teaching.
    - and of mutual, contribution in kind, reinvestment in supporting pay-what-you-can, or other embedding in non-profit/cooperative needs.
- Meta
    - Good to be pushed to think about all this. I hesitate to hint at derailing, but in some ways, a desirable outcome for this for me might just be a weekly "Thinking of Starting a Coop" or "Thinking of how to be a better collaborator with coops" checkin and accountability call that results in 3 or more coops being formed over time out of some of us and many others.
    - That's probably compatible with supporting each other to find and work with clients that match a shared vision for collective tech work, at which point...

### Skills

To contribute
- Python web & api development with Django, Flask
- Python data manipulation with Pandas (but it's been a bit)
- Node.js web & api development with Express, GraphQL
- Browser js with webpack, babel, react or lit-element
- Not-entirely-modern HTML/CSS but usually rely on bootstrap more or less.
- Automated testing and integration, wherever.
- A thousand and one ways to ingest a CSV file.
- Data design, integration in SQL, Mongo, ElasticSearch
- Containerized deploys with Heroku, Github Actions, AWS ECS
- Serverless / background job / stream processing with Redis, AWS Lambda
- Project communication, sprint planning, expectation management.

And to learn more
- Storybook-style client-side JS
- ActivityPub
- Learning a new language (will it be Typescript or Elm or Clojure?)
- Business development (I'm glad the rest of you say you want to get better at this too, yikes!)

### Consulting Background

From other's goals and questions, I think it's worth sharing different configurations we've worked in, as another jumping off spot, though clearly there are books where someone spent actual time thinking things through unlike me tonight.

- Consulting as fixed-price product.
    - Usually submitting a proposal for a particular scope, estimate, and timeline. Whether competitively bid or not, usually only successful through pre-bid conversations with the client.
    - I get why this appeals to organizations on both sides of the contract, how it shares risk, but it does not build trust without great project management, a tension to deliver useful software things in an agile way.
    - This is how most agency work I've been involved in is sold.
- Consulting as time-and-materials contract
    - In my experience, subcontract staffing or follow-on support work.
    - But that's usually me, subcontract staff.
- Consulting as a costs-saved engagement
    - Limited fields where this applies, where value to the organization can be so clearly linked to a particular set of implemented changes.
    - But nicely aligns everybody's efforts, when the costs being saved are AWS monthly bills or mailing costs, not staff reductions.
- Consulting as training and technical assistance
    - Either as expertise on a new platform to internal technical staff, or content development of training materials.
- Freelancing or consulting as staff augmentation
    - Key difference in my mind is working with a client's existing technical staff to develop internal or shared product/features. Usually T&M, with regular renewal/evaluation.
    - Main downside is less transferrable experience or reputation, but as a freelancer it's often nice to be on a team.
- Freelancing for a particular scope, either fixed-price or hourly.
    - For particularly small engagements, or for open source feature bounties, say.
    - Lower risk on both sides when anything software-related is actually small enough to describe and well understood.
