I'm a traveller, a constructor, a deconstructor and explorer of intellectual space. I've spent most of my life working on the internet, building backends and de-fanging data. I work remotely from my home in central Georgia (and wherever traveling) these days.

Current interests:
- Contract or volunteer internet software development projects in the domains of social justice, education, and a distributed decentralized model for the future web.
- Woodworking, woodturning, tree climbing, forestry
- Gardening and permaculture-inspired ecosystem management in middle Georgia.

Interests on hold:
- Molecular Biology, in particular cell- and genome-level systems of disease.
- Emergency Medicine - I am a lapsed NOLS Wilderness EMT-B.
- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
- Semantic Web / RDF / OpenCyc
