Mulling over my base principles in contemplating a tech-oriented cooperative way of working, I'm influenced by [The ICA's Principles](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity#cooperative-principles), Noah's [Personal Tech Ethics](https://www.nthall.com/posts/personal-tech-ethics-audit/) and its sources in the [IWOC](https://incarceratedworkers.org/resources/iwoc-technology-policy) and [Design Justice](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles), and Autonomic's [Principles](https://autonomic.zone/blog/our-founding-principles/).

1. **Democratic egalitarian member control.**<br> Very influenced by Sociocracy here, that hierarchy when delegated from and accountable to below has its place (but I'm also comfortably mutualist in preferring small enough organizations to be internally flat), and that Consensus Without Argued Objection supports commitment to sustainable and principled decisions.

2. **Diverse inclusive relationship to humanity, centering and accountable to impacted communities.**<br> Can I try to tackle privilege in a paragraph? I'm likely mostly talking to white folk, and I resonate with James Baldwin and Resmaa Menakem asking us to confront our privilege rather than trying to pull in black and brown labor to assuage our sense of isolation and guilt. Concretely I think this most directly entails offering mutual aid and being accountable for the impacts my decisions have on common safety.

3. **Sustainable economics and ecology, opposition to exploitation.**<br> The categories of exploitative relationships I currently participate in is frighteningly large. From funding, employers, consumers, incarceration and all varieties of police and border state policies, fossil fuels, colonization, animal and ecological tragedy ... almost without thought to the violence we condone.

4. **Open commons, for the common good of people.**<br> I've always been proud of my peripheral attachment to the open source community, for the promise of de-fettered increase in access to technology and freedom to tinker, but in recent years this has muddled to a stronger view about commons and ethics, not sure I can put it better than Noah's "oppose the current paradigm of Open Source that is designed for benefits to redound to large corporations, and take great issue with the largely value-neutral ideology of Free (Libre) Software."

5. **Transparent education and information, facilitating understanding.**<br> I think it's worth specfically calling out the value of education, of sharing knowledge transparently, and listening in facilitation of growing the human capacity around us. This is the positively stated aspect of Open Source, beyond source code, that I want to continue to believe in.

6. **Privacy and decentralization for autonomy & independence.**<br> Inspired by ICA principle 4 and finding a renewed excitement for rejecting advertising-driven technology in the Fediverse, I specifically want technology I create to center personal safety and collective autonomy, and to recognize that participation in a freely public commons is only safe to the extent of one's privilege.
