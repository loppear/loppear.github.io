title: "Years End: Building worthwhile things"

Wrapping up 2015 - my second year of independent contracting - it's a good time to reflect. I've continued to have the opportunity to work on interesting, positive projects this year, with a mix of old and new faces on the other side of the virtual desk.

This was the year of React.js for me: while still developing backend platforms for most projects, nearly every project has been frontend heavy and made use of React for organizing and rendering the user interface. This year also marks a return to all Node.js work - I would love a chance to work with the latest Python releases, but Node and the fluid movement of development from server to client have me busy with Javascript.

One nice thing about exclusively working on short-term projects is that everything I helped build this fall is already live and in production:

 * [CAIT Business Emissions and Targets](http://cait.wri.org/business) for [World Resources Institute](http://www.wri.org/), working with [Seabourne Consulting](http://www.seabourneinc.com/) again for the first time this year. Wonderful to be helping expand the climate data tools that WRI has developed over the last several years, this time with an advocacy goal of motivating global companies to commit to meaningful emissions reductions targets.

 * [The Toughlings](http://thetoughlings.org/) for Floating Children's Hospital, helping [Nail Communications](http://nail.cc/) get this quick kid-focused project out the door before the holidays.

 * An internationalization project, supporting both content and UI translation for a learning management platform, Fathom Learning working with [Mindspace](http://mindspace.net/).

And as always, it's great to feel like these projects are contributing to the greater good. Thanks for a good year, everyone!
