I'm excited by the new O'Reilly book [BioBuilder: Rethinking the biological sciences as engineering disciplines](http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/06/biobuilder-rethinking-the-biological-sciences-as-engineering-disciplines.html), as I've watched the [BioBuilder](http://www.biobuilder.org) and [IGEM Parts](http://parts.igem.org/) projects passively over the last few years work towards repeatable programming of biological components. While that's a whole topic of its own, the release of this book co-authored by Natalie Kuldell reminded me to look at the MIT OCW site for the [Biological Engineering department](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/) where she is faculty. I've been somewhat hesitant to jump into this field for lack of background, but reviewing the course list made me realize I've skimmed into likely pre-requisites a fair bit over the last year.

The following courses appear to have a good selection of material (video lectures or lecture notes, assignments or exams with solutions) that I'll consider working through them this year:

 * [Chemicals in the Environment: Toxicology and Public Health (BE.104J) from 2005](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-104j-chemicals-in-the-environment-toxicology-and-public-health-be-104j-spring-2005/) from 2005, lecture notes for background, quantitative risk assessment, but not toxicology; problem sets and exams.
 * [Systems Microbiology](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-106j-systems-microbiology-fall-2006/lecture-notes/) from 2006. Lecture notes, slides, problem sets, and exams.
 * [Analysis of Biomolecular and Cellular Systems](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-320-analysis-of-biomolecular-and-cellular-systems-fall-2012/index.htm) from 2012. Lecture notes, and partial problem sets / exams from 2009-2012.
 * [Thermodynamics of Biomolecular Systems](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-110j-thermodynamics-of-biomolecular-systems-fall-2005/lecture-notes/) from 2005. Lecture notes.
 * [Materials for Biomedical Applications](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-051j-materials-for-biomedical-applications-spring-2006/lecture-notes/) from 2006. Lecture notes, problem sets, and example final exam.
 * [Molecular Structure of Biological Materials (BE.442)](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-442-molecular-structure-of-biological-materials-be-442-fall-2005/lecture-notes/) from 2005. Lecture notes and exam.
 * [Foundations of Computational and Systems Biology](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-91j-foundations-of-computational-and-systems-biology-spring-2014/) from 2014. Video lectures, notes, problem sets.
 * [Mechanisms of Drug Actions](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biological-engineering/20-201-mechanisms-of-drug-actions-fall-2013/lecture-and-recitation-slides/) from 2013. Partial lecture notes, problem sets, and exams from 2011-2013.

I'll update this post with links to any notes from reviewing these classes!
